# Canvas LLM Extender
Let the OpenAI LLM add nodes to your canvas. Only works on text nodes for now, probably breaks when using other nodes.

Go to settings and configure your API key.
Right click a node in your canvas and select LLM Extender and the plugin will automatically add a new outgoing edge to a new node. The text in the new node is generated by OpenAI based on your nearby (edge-wise) nodes

## Suggested contributions (aka TODO)
- Add support for other nodes
- Add support for other AI services
- Verify use of sibling nodes as input to prompt
- Support multiple prompt based actions
- Limit number of tokens in output
- Clean up code to be more javascriptic
- Solve the stuff I used ts-ignore on
- Handle errors
- Install instructions, better readme, example video

## State
Pre alpha - I wrote until it seems to work for me.
